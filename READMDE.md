## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Been a while, so rather rusty on managing spacing, as well as aligning items with each other.

### Continued development

A lot more practice with flexbox - still have trouble wrapping my head around some aspects. Fine with the basics, which was all that was needed for this one.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Always a go-to resource for anything web related. Sometimes a bit obtuse, but it's **all** there.
